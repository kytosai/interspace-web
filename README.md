## Explain about project

Demo: https://interspace-web.vercel.app/

Build with: Nextjs, Redux, Typescript, SCSS

- Currently some of the free mock api services that I know of are not able to meet my requirements, I decided to build a mock api service on my personal VPS. Because it is a cheap VPS and is in a time when the internet is not stable, sometimes the api will be quite slow, if there is an error, please contact me so I can handle it immediately for the demo.
  - Repo mock api: https://github.com/kytosai/interspace-api
  - Mock api live: https://interspace-api.kytosai.com  

- Regarding this test project in my experience this is a website that will have a complex and highly customizable interface, so I have decided not to use any UI framework. Also because time is limited and some information about UI/UX is not complete (responsive UI for some components on mobile, breakpoint, font-size/line-height standard,...etc), I have tried to complete the project as much as possible. However, there will be a lot of things that are not good, I hope if I can continue to participate in the technical interview, I will have the opportunity to present and answer your any questions about this project.
  - For example: some components have not been optimized for reuse by me (button...).

- Because for the convenience of website demo, I would like to put the source code on my personal repo to deploy on vercel. In addition, I have put a version on the `dev` branch in the repository containing the main requirement.
  - Repo to deploy vercel demo: https://github.com/kytosai/interspace-web
  - Repo test requirement: https://github.com/interspace-obs/frontend-test-for-kytosai

Through the information about the company described, I am so excited to stand the opportunity to be part of your amazing team and i can contribute my energy to your development journey!

Thank you! Wishing you all a wonderful day!
